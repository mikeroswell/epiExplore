# Overview 

$k$, the shape parameter of a gamma, or size/dispresion parameter of a negative
binomial, is the canonical but confusing way of describing nb dispersion. It is
confusing b/c it is inversely related to dispersion. It can be re-written more
generally (see below), allowing us to see that $k$ shows pathological behavior
as $\mu \to \sigma$, approaching positive infinity when $\sigma > \mu$ and
positive infinity when $\mu > \sigma$. While $k$ is a canonical parameter for
gamma & negative-binomial distributions, it may be less intuitive for other
families of distributions.

Several other measures of dispersion may be computed either based on the moments
of a distribution or a sample from it, for example, the coefficient of variation
$CV = \sigma / \mu$, its cousin, $\kappa = 1/CV^2 = \mu^2/\sigma^2$, and the
Gini coefficient, $G = \frac{\sum_{i}\sum_{j} |x_i -
x_j|}{2\sum_{i}\sum_{j}x_i}$
