Emergent heterogeneity has two sources: the first is stochastic and depends on mean of the underlying activity distribution; the second emerges from the structure of a compartmental model. Inequality in initial secondary case distributions depends on R0, inequality in activity distributions does not. (a) activity distributions (density curves) and secondary case distributions (density histograms) for the outset of an SIR epidemic with mean recovery rate of 0.1/day and transmission rates of 0.15 (green) and 0.8 (orange). (b) inequality curves for the activity distributions are identical (and indestinguishable due to overplotting); inequality in the secondary case distribution decreases with R0. (c) When models include explicit heterogeneity (purple) this is affects both the activity and the secondary case distributions. Orange density histograms and density curves  as in (a), purple from an analogous branching process model, now with explicit heterogeneity (23% of cases have 6.67x the transmission rate as the other 77% of cases, R0 still 8). (d)  


In panels (a,c), the secondary case distribution probability mass functions (PMFs) are plotted as density histograms with unit binwidths; in this way the ploted PMFs area = 1, enabling visual comparison with the activity distribution density functions (smooth curves), the area under which is also 1. Because the first bin (at zero) sits at the boundary of the domain, we have plotted this bin as double the density and half the width, preserving the area-to-area comrrespondence. This allows more natural visual comparison with the density functions.
