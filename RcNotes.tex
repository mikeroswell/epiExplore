Start with the normalized SIR:

$$ i = Bxy; \dot x = -i; \dot y = i-y $$

If $C$ is the case reproductive number for an individual (the same for all individuals infected at an instant), then the overall mean is:

$$
	\bar C 
	= \frac{\int{dt\, i(t) C(t)}}{\int{dt\, i(t)}}
	= \frac{\int{dt\, i(t) C(t)}}{Z}, 
$$

where $Z$ is the size of the epidemic.

We can write

$$C(t) =
