Start with the normalized SIR:

$$ i = Bxy; \dot x = -i; \dot y = i-y $$

If $C(t)$ is the case reproductive number for an individual infected at time $t$, then the overall mean is:

$$
	\bar C 
	= \frac{\int{dt\, i(t) C(t)}}{\int{dt\, i(t)}}
	= \frac{\int{dt\, i(t) C(t)}}{Z}, 
$$

where $Z$ is the size of the epidemic.

We can integrate over time since infection $\delta$, and write:

$$C(t) = B \int{d\delta\, x(t+\delta) \exp(-\delta)}$$

We can also solve the $\dot y$ equation, by looking at who has come in $\tau$ time ago and how many of them survived:

$$ y(t) = \int{d\tau\, i(t-\tau)\exp(-\tau)}$$

There should be some good trick for re-arranging this to get $\bar C$, and we're going to work on that, even though it's not at all clear that it would help with $\kappa_C$.

JD thought earlier that the next step would be to expand the first integral, so let's try that:

\begin{eqnarray}
	Z \bar C \\
	&=& \int{dt\, i(t) C(t)} \\
	&=& B \int{dt\, x(t) y(t) C(t)} \\
	&=& B \int{dt\, x(t) \int{d\tau\, i(t-\tau)\exp(-\tau)} C(t)} \\
	&=& B^2 \int{dt\, x(t) \int{d\tau\, i(t-\tau)\exp(-\tau)} \int{d\delta\, x(t+\delta) \exp(-\delta)}}
\end{eqnarray}

The next thing might be to rewrite in terms of event times, e.g., $\sigma=t-\tau$, $\theta=t+\delta$:

\begin{eqnarray}
	Z \bar C
	\\ &=& B^2 \int_{\sigma<t<\theta}{dQ\, x(t) i(\sigma)\exp(\sigma-t) x(\theta) \exp(t-\theta)}
	\\ &=& B^2 \int_{\sigma<t<\theta}{dQ\, x(t) i(\sigma) x(\theta) \exp(\sigma-\theta)}
\end{eqnarray}
