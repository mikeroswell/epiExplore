We encountered two problems. The first was kind of expected, which is that things are fragile if the maximum is on the boundary and the optimizer does not find it exactly. The second was a bit weird and may be numerical or fundamental: the Hessian estimated sd was smaller than seemed reasonable.

JD should write some math notes and get a tiny bit more clarity about the second one, but is also feeling comfortable with letting this approach go.
