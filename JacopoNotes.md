# notes from conversation with Jacopo 10 April 2025

- Can we sharpen our expressions for within and between, and get traction on limits? 
- Lagrange multipliers, taylor expansions, delta functions
- Trick of writing delta as limit of gaussian when sigma ->0
- Does variance actually stay at 1 as R0 -> infinity, or might it suddenly collapse to 0?
- likewise, as R0 ->1, how does the epidemic end (our intuition right now relies on final size being positive)
- Using expressions at the limit to write down moments differently
- Build intuition about within and between at the limits.
