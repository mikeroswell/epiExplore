# epiExplore

This repository is for developing ideas about implied and explicitly-encoded
flavors of heterogeneity in epidemic models. 

## Navigation
See the Makefile to see how this repository is organized

## make 
Most of the scripts here are set up to use **shellpipes** and be called from the 
Makefile using **make**

## To do

Write up notes on what we learned about biased estimation

Make a simple, slick machine to do SIR IBMs with one class and see what we can learn about the Roswell conjecture (variance of individual R's â‰ˆ 1)

Annotate some of the other stuff in the Makefile (in the Makefile, where appropriate, but also some of it into outline.md)
