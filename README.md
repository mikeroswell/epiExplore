# epiExplore

This repository is for developing ideas about implied and explicitly-encoded
flavors of heterogeneity in epidemic models. The first set of scripts and 
documents is focused on the idea of $D_0$, or the distribution in *individual
reproductive number* about the mean, $R_0$. 

## files
`myLloyd-Smith.R` is basically what's in Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005 Nature, but I
am looking at inequalities in the intrinsic, realized, and
positive-offspring-filtered distributions of the individual reproductive
numbers.

`Learn_distributions.R` is a self-study to get intuitions about linkages between
exponential & gamma distributions and their realizations as discrete geometric
and negative binomials.

`two_speeds.R` is my `R` implementation of a little sketch JSW shared in matlab.
